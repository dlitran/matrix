# matrix
Linear maps = transformations of vectors. They are represented as objects called matrices in the finite-dimensional case.

There are other types of vectors such as real/complex plynomial spaces and function spaces.

# Examples of  use or linear algebra

- physics: Newtonian mehcanics, other branches of physics dependent on linear algebra (multivariable calculus, topologoy, differential geometry, tensor algebra, operator theory...), quantum mechanics: linear algebra and multivariable calculus over complex numbers. General relativity: differential geometry and tensor algebra,
- videogames *High performance computing and Numerical Analysis depend on linear algebra.

- Statistics (and thus data science and machine learning). Numerical data is often represented as vectors in large-dimensional spaces.

	- Analogies between statistical concepts and linear algebra:	
	- covariance -> dot product
	- variance -> quadratic norm
	- standard deviation -> norm
	- Pearson correlation coefficient -> cosine of the angle between two vectors
	- Normalizing a Gaussian curve -> normalizing a vector

- Constrains for language of choice:
generic types, support functions as first class citizens (lambda expressions)?
- support for operator overloading

- time/space complexity will be checked.
- time complexity -> number of operations
- space complexity -> max amount of memory allocated simultaneously.

- calculated agains N (input size).
